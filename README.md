# SproutIOSGame
This is a game that I made with a team of game developers during my time at the National High School Game Academy at CMU. It is a 2D Story Game focused around 2D platforming, and timing puzzles, combined with an emotional story. This game was brainstormed and designed in 1 week, and fully developed in 2 weeks.
